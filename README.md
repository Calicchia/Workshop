# Workshop Responsive Web Design Based On CSS GRID

### Today I want you to build a webpage using only CSS grid to create your website's layout. 
                                RIP Bootstrap(for one day :))
                           
### Why?
I believe it will give you an insight on how to create layouts. In the future you will easier build the grid all by yourself which gives you full control of your webpage. It will help you organise your webpage and make it beautifull for all devices. 

### What?
You can choose your project. This can be a portfilio, product landing page, photo gallery,...
Some examples:

 [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
 [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
 
### How?
I found this great video at the beginning of our training. This helped me a lot to understand creating layouts. It takes only one hour and I recommend to watch it. [Become a Grid Master with this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6CBKf8K_Ac&t=3119s)

Today is all about understanding your layout. Start with the basics and build your grid. Use colours to see how everything shows on your website. Once your grid is fully worked out you can start to zoom in and add more content details. 

Work this way:
1. Idea
2. Sketch
3. Build the Frame(Responsive for all devices)
4. Build the inner Frame
5. Start adding content

### Questions? 
I'm here to help and learn. Don't hesitate to ask questions as we can both learn something from it!
